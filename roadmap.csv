,Roadmap ,
Date of Publication: 01/03/2026 ,,
Project Status: Active Development ,,
Target Environment: Tor (.onion) and I2P (eepsite) ,,
1. Project Roles and Governance ,,
"To ensure the successful delivery of Splinterstice as a decentralized, 2.5D hidden service, the ",,
following organizational structure is established: ,,
● ,General Project Manager (GMP) & Head Developer: Lead architect and final authority ,
,for the Splinterstice codebase. Responsible for architectural oversight of the 2.5D engine ,
,"and Ruby on Rails API, security auditing of E2EE subsystems, core backend ",
,"development (socket clustering/IPFS), and release management of the master branch ",
,on Openmesh. ,
● ,Project Organizer: Operational lead assisting the GMP. Responsible for documentation ,
,"management (spec/roadmap), community relations on Tor/I2P directories and social ",
,"platforms, coordinating human-review escalations for the Hybrid Expert System, and ",
,administrative task tracking. ,
● ,Open-Source Development Team: A decentralized group of contributors. ,
,○ ,Frontend: JavaScript/CSS depth effect implementation and adaptive layout 
,management. ,
,○ ,"Backend/DevOps: Docker/Kubernetes orchestration, Redis caching, and "
,MySQL schema maintenance. ,
,○ ,"Security: E2EE refinement, Tor/I2P tunnel optimization, and WAPP hardening. "
,○ ,Plugin Devs: Development of interactable 2.5D objects and multimedia preview 
,handlers. ,

3. Assumptions ,,,
● ,"AS-01: Users possess a basic understanding of darknet navigation, including Tor ",,
,Browser and I2P tunnel configurations. ,,
● ,AS-02: Openmesh provides sufficient uptime and bandwidth for the primary node ,,
,deployment through IPFS. ,,
● ,AS-03: The community will provide sufficient hardware for self-hosting individual ,,
,Homespaces to ensure true decentralization. ,,
● ,AS-04: Modern browsers used in darknets support the necessary JavaScript ES6+ ,,
,features and CSS depth effects required for 2.5D rendering. ,,

5. Dependencies ,,,
● ,Openmesh Infrastructure: Required for the decentralized deployment of the main ,,
,node. ,,
● ,"IPFS Protocol: The primary ""middleman"" for backend-to-node connectivity and file ",,
,storage. ,,
● ,Ruby on Rails 7.x: The core framework for the Splinterstice API and DB Network ,,
,management. ,,
● ,MySQL & Redis: Required for the dual-layer persistent (user data) and ephemeral (chat ,,
,data) network. ,,
● ,Docker & Kubernetes: Necessary for the automated orchestration of socket clusters ,,
,and network scalability. ,,

7. Notes on Estimates ,
Estimates are based on current open-source contributor velocity. The decentralized nature of ,
the socket clusters and IPFS integration may introduce variability in testing timelines. Milestones ,
are subject to shift based on the results of the Phase 5 Darknet Sandbox testing. ,
