Splinterstice is a decentralized web-based IM(instant messenger) designed with free speech absolutism at its core, as to circumvent the pitfalls of centralized control and online censorship. Those being issues that are unfortunately more often than not directly perpetuated by, if not, at least enabled by entities on the clearnet. That in turn, is what's been leading to superficial polarization and groupthink within so-called "online communities" of all sort, thst inhabit the clearnet, amongst various other issues that stem from the aforementioned ones.

Hence, why Splinterstice is to serve as a more privacy-focused, as well as overall secure communication alternative to platforms such as Discord, KiwiIRC, Revolt, XMPP, and those based on Fediverse, the Matrix messaging protocol, or anything else that's solely (if not primarily) based within the clearnet. One of the key things that truly sets Splinterstice apart is its focus on niche online groups operating on what can broadly be described as "miscellaneous hidden services" within specifically Tor and I2P. That's due to these groups hailing from hidden services that don't fall under the typical labels of either "dark-web"(illicit/explicitly illegal hidden services) or "deep-web"(research-oriented hidden services that can technically be often found on the clearnet anyways).

Splinterstice's primary target demographic are individuals who inhabit these specific types of hidden services, which have been chosen due to also being the same exact criteria that a .onion or eepsite needs to fall under to be considered a "miscellaneous hidden service":

- Currently up and running eccentric/niche hobbyist .onion sites and eepsites.
- Currently up and running obscure .onion and eepsite imageboards.  
- Currently up and running niche interest forums on Tor and I2P.
- Currently up and running shitposting .onion sites and eepsites.
- Currently up and running .onion sites and eepsites whereas the sort of memes shared on there are too intense or shocking for being posted anywhere on the clearnet i.e NSFL(in this context meaning generally disturbing, not just gore) memes.

By having those smaller niche online groups make up Splinterstice's online environments, Splinterstice thereby ensures higher quality posts without interference from mainstream or centralized platforms, largely in part due to said groups being the nichest of the niche, in our current era.
