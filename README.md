Splinterstice is a decentralized, web-based IM(instant messenger) designed with free speech absolutism at its core, as to circumvent the pitfalls of centralized control and online censorship. Which are issues that are often directly perpetuated (if not at least enabled) by entities on the clearnet, leading to superficial polarization and groupthink within so-called "online communities."

Hence, why Splinterstice is to serve as a privacy-focused, secure communication alternative to platforms such as Discord, KiwiIRC, Revolt, XMPP, and those based on Fediverse or the Matrix messaging protocol. One of the key things that truly sets Splinterstice apart is its focus on niche online groups operating on what can broadly be described as "miscellaneous hidden services" within specifically Tor and I2P. That's due to these groups hailing from hidden services that don't fall under the typical labels of either "dark-web"(illicit/explicitly illegal hidden services) or "deep-web"(research-oriented hidden services).

Splinterstice's primary target demographic are individuals who inhabit these specific types of hidden services:

- Currently up eccentric/niche hobbyist .onion sites and eepsites.
- Currently up obscure .onion and eepsite imageboards.  
- Currently up Niche interest forums on Tor and I2P.
- Currently up Shitposting .onion sites and eepsites.
- Currently up .onion sites and eepsites whereas the sort of memes shared on there are too intense or shocking for being posted anywhere on the clearnet i.e NSFL(in this context meaning generally disturbing, not just gore) memes.

By having those smaller niche online groups make up Splinterstice's online environments, Splinterstice thereby ensures higher quality posts without interference from mainstream or centralized platforms.
